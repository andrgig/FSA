This code was used in "Fast feature selection for Learning to Rank" (2016) by A. Gigli, C. Lucchese, R. Perego, F. Nardini  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2970433.

You can clone it ad run simply running in bash the following command

0_prepare_data.sh `"YOU_DIRECTORY"` `<FEATURES_NUMBER>`

1_run_fast_feature_selection.sh

2_run_competitors.sh

3_effectiveness_performance.sh

The code demo is ready to be tested on sample data extracted from [*istella LETOR dataset](http://blog.istella.it/istella-learning-to-rank-dataset/). The dataset contains 220 features in SVM format.
